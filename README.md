# Verbatim
 The "Follow Channel" Discord feature, but for everyone
 
 You may have had this problem before. You manage a bunch of discords, and you'd like to announce to all of your users something important, maybe update some rules, but it's a pain to go through each discord doing ctrl-c ctrl-v to get your point across. Sure there's discord's built in follow channel feature, but that only works on verified discords, and you don't have that privledge. 
 
 Introducing **Verbatim**, a simple, straightforward, no bs bot that does it for you. Maybe even better...
 
 
## How many steps does it take? Let's count. 1, 2, 3, 4 done
 Verbatim has an extremely easy set up process, here's how to do it
 
 1. Register yourself with *register {a nickname of your choice}*
    - That's it, do that once and you're ready to start making paths 
 2. Create a path with *createpath {name of path}* 
    - A path name has to be unique, but don't worry about sharing names with others, unique path names are specific to YOU
 3. Add branches with *addbranch {name of path}*
    - Do this in a channel of your choice, once you do that the channel is "attached" to your path, then you're ready to publish
 4. Publish a message with *publish {name of path} {content}*
    - Do this in your path's "Hub", by default it's set to wherever you created the path, but you can change it via *-sethub {path name}*
